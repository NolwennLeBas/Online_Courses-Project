    The subjects are too grouped to be really informative, so what would be interesting would be to create subcategories in each subject based on key words of the course title for example.
    Building the model on this type of subcategories would allow it to better identify patterns about rating, price, academy,... related to specific type of courses instead of merging everything together and trying to predict based on the Subject.
    Furthermore, this type of prediction would be better if the model was built on a year by year dataset has there could be a slowing down in the number of students during the last 2 years for example.
