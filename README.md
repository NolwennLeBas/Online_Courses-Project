# Online_Courses-Project

#### Project Description:

Recent years have seen an increase in interest towards online courses and formations. Hence, studying factors such as course subject, prices, rating, etc. might help us understand what influences customers in choosing an online course. To study those trends, I'll use some data that was scrapped from 2 online academies:
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/); reference dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/udemy-courses)
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/); reference dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santoshapatil31/edx-all-courses-3082-courses)

##### Goals:
- Understand current trends/popularity of the courses
- Compare the 2 online academies
- Predict the growth in number of students on a 4 year timeframe
